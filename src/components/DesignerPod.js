        Designing has always been a passion of mine, ever since I first started to learn Adobe Photoshop all of those
        years ago. You know what as good as programming is, I still believe that the most creative people, can grasp
        ideas from both sides of the tree. My creativity comes from everything around me. That is how I get my
        inspiration. I am a huge fan of Japanese anime, my favourite show being the Dragonball series. The amazing
        drawing styles and animations in animeâ€™s, have always captivated my imagination.

        I do like to draw from time to time. I am self taught, and like a lot of my skills, I have been honing and
        improving them non stop throughout the years. I like being versatile and this ability to design my own
        creatives, makes me unique as not all Developers have an eye for design!
